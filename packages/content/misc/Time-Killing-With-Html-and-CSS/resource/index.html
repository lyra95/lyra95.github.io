					We are all still in shock here from uncle Randy's sudden passing. While we wait on word
					from the examiner about the cause we are coping as best we can I've been occupying myself
					sorting through his things, especially his computers. Of course, I took one look in the
					garage and it all looks like a bunch of junk to me. I'll send some pictures when I get a
					chance.
					<br />
					<br />
					For now, this is the machine that was set up on his workbench when he died. maybe you'll
					be able to figure out what he was doing with it He would've liked to know someone was
					going to finish his work.

			<p>
				The Tessellated Intelligence System is a massively parallel computer architecture compirsed
				of non-uniformly interconnected heterogeneous nodes.
				<mark>
					The Tessellated Intelligence System is ideal for applications requiring complex data
					stream processing, such as automated financial trading, bulk data collection, and civilian
					behavioral analysis.
				</mark>

					<b>Note: </b>
					Notes like this one will appear in this manual to indicate scenarios requiring special
					attention and to refer to other documents that contain more information on a topic.

			<h1 class="page-title">SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND ORGANIZATION</h1>
			<hr class="solid" />
			<p>
				The Tessellated Intelligence System consists of a large number of independent nodes
				connected on a local basis. (Refer to the model-specific manual to find the precise node
				population counts present on a particular device.) Node types can be broadly classified as
				processing or storage, with several variants within each category.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally, nodes are connected to up to four neighbors via ports. Ports enable lightweight
				message-passing communication between nodes. Communication over ports is coordinated by
				allowing either node to issue a read or write to a port and blocking until the request is
				filled by the corresponding node.
			</p>
			<div class="note">
				<p>
					<b>Note: </b>
					If two nodes issue the same communication command (read or write) on the connection
					between them, the nodes will deadlock and a hardware fault will occur. Refer to the
					separate document "Tessellated Intelligence System Best Practices-Patterens of Node
					Communication" for details on how to use ports effectively and safely.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note: </b>
					If a node issues a communication command and it is never fulfilled by the corresponding
					node, the node will deadlock and a hardware fault will occur. (Exceptions to this rule
					exists; refer to the documentation of specific node types for details) Refer to the
					separate document "Tessellated Intelligence System Best Practices-Patterens of Node
					Communication" for details on how to use ports effectively and safely.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note: </b>
					This document does not describe timing or throughput for node communication operations or
					instructions, as these values vary by model and hardware revision. Refer to the
					model-specific manual for a detailed description of performance characteristics of a
					particular device.

			<h1 class="page-title">NODE TYPE T21 - BASIC EXECUTION NODE</h1>
			<hr class="solid" />
			<div>
				<h2 class="section">1. Architecture</h2>
				<p>
					The Basic Execution Node is responsible for coordinating the behavior of the Tessellated
					Intelligence System. Processing can occur within the Basic Execution Node, or can be
					delegated to specialized processing and storage nodes.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Basic Execution Node executes a program specified in the Basic Execution Node
					Instruction Set. A Basic Execution Node program specifies computational and communication
					operations to perform. Operations are performed sequentially, beginning with the first
					instruction in the program.
					<mark>
						After executing the last instruction of the program, execution automatically continues
						to the first instruction.
					</mark>
					This behavior supports the common usage of Basic Execution Nodes, in which programs are
					written to operate in a continuous loop.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to the communication ports common to all Tessellated Intelligence System
					nodes, the Basic Execution Node contains a number of registers that are used in the
					execution of its program. No additional memory is available on the Basic Execution Node;
					if additional storage is required, the node should coordinate with another Basic Execution
					Node or a storage node.
				</p>
				<p>
					All registers store integer values between -999 and 999 (inclusive). The representation of
					register values is implementation-defined, and knowledge of the representation is not
					required to program the Basic Execution Node.
				</p>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-1. ACC</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Internal</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> ACC is the primary storage register for a Basic Execution Node. ACC
						is used as the implicit source or destination operand of many instructions, including
						arithmetic and conditional instructions.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-2. BAK</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Internal (non-addressable)</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> BAK is temporary storage for values in ACC. It is only accessible
						through the SAV and SWP instructions,
						<mark> and cannot be read or written directly. </mark>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-3. NIL</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Internal (special)</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> Reading NIL produces the value zero. Writing to NIL has no effect.
						NIL can be used as a destination operand to execute an instruction for its side effects
						only, discarding the result.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-4. LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Port</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The four communication registers UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT
						correspond to the four ports that all Basic Execution Nodes use to communicate with
						topologically adjacent nodes. Some ports will be disconnected on certain nodes within
						the hardware, and will block indefinitely if a READ or WRITE command is issued. Refer to
						the interconnection diagram for the node to determine which ports are available for use.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-5. ANY</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Port (pseudo-port)</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> When ANY is used as the source of an instruction, the instruction
						will read the first value that becomes available on any port. When ANY is used as the
						destination of an instruction, the result of the instruction will be sent to the first
						node that reads from any port on this node.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">1-6. LAST</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Type: Port (pseudo-port)</b>
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> LAST refers to the port last read or written using the ANY
						pseudo-port. It otherwise behaves identically to explicitly specifying a port. Reading
						from or writing to LAST before it has been set by a successful read or write using the
						ANY pseudo-port will result in implementation-defined behavior. Refer to the separate
						document “Tessellated Intelligence System Best Practices - Patterns of Node
						Communication” for sample code demonstrating the use of the LAST pseudo-port.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="section">2. Instruction Set</h2>
				<p>
					&lt;SRC&gt; and &lt;DST&gt; instruction parameters may specify a port or internal
					register. Any use of a port will block until the corresponding node connected to that port
					completes the communication by reading or writing a value. Additionally, a &lt;SRC&gt;
					parameter may be a literal integer value between -999 and 9909 (inclusive).
				</p>
				<p>
					BAK cannot be specified as a &lt;SRC&gt; or &lt;DST&gt; operand. The value of BAK is only
					accessible through special instructions SAV and SWP.
				</p>
				<p>
					&lt;LABEL&gt; parameters are arbitrary textual names used to specify jump targets within
					the program.
				</p>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-1. Comments</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b># COMMENT TEXT
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> All text including and after the comment symbol (#) is ignored.
					</p>
					<div class="note">
						<p>
							<b>Note: </b>
							<br />
							Text placed after two comment symbols (##) will be used as the title of the program in
							which it occurs, and is displayed in the debugger to make browsing programs easier.
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-2. Labels</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>&lt;LABEL&gt;:
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> Labels are used to identify targets for jump instructions. When used
						as a jump target, the instruction following the label will be executed next.
						<br />
						<b>Examples:</b>
						<br />
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>LOOP:</dt>
						<dd>This label is on a line by itself.</dd>
						<dt>L: MOV 8, ACC</dt>
						<dd>This label is on a line with another instruction</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-3. NOP</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>NOP
						<br />
						<b>Equivalent Syntax: </b>ADD NIL
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> NOP is a pseudo-instruction that has no effect on the node's
						internal state or communication ports. NOP is automatically converted to the instruction
						ADD NIL.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-4. MOV</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>MOV &lt;SRC&gt;, &lt;DST&gt;
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> &lt;SRC&gt; is read and the resulting value is written to
						&lt;DST&gt;.
						<br />
						<b>Examples:</b>
						<br />
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>MOV 8, ACC</dt>
						<dd>The literal value 8 is written to the ACC register.</dd>
						<dt>MOV LEFT, RIGHT</dt>
						<dd>A value is read from the LEFT port, and then written to RIGHT.</dd>
						<dt>MOV UP, NIL</dt>
						<dd>A value is read from the UP port and then discarded.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-5. SWP</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>SWP
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The values of ACC and BAK are exchanged.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-6. SAV</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>SAV
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The value of ACC is written to BAK.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-7. ADD</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>ADD &lt;SRC&gt;
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The value of &lt;SRC&gt;is added to the value of ACC and the result
						is stored to ACC.
						<br />
						<b>Examples:</b>
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>ADD 16</dt>
						<dd>The literal value 16 is added to the value in the ACC register.</dd>
						<dt>ADD LEFT</dt>
						<dd>ADD LEFT A value is read from the LEFT port, and then added to ACC.</dd>
					</dl>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-8. SUB</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>SUB &lt;SRC&gt;
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The value of &lt;SRC&gt; is subtracted from the value of ACC and the
						result is stored to ACC.
						<br />
						<b>Examples:</b>
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>SUB 16</dt>
						<dd>The literal value 16 is subtracted from the value in the ACC register.</dd>
						<dt>SUB LEFT</dt>

				</div>
				<div>
					<h3 class="subsection">2-9. NEG</h3>
					<p>
						<b>Syntax: </b>NEG
						<br />
						<b>Description:</b> The value of ACC is arithmetically negated. A value of zero remains
						the same.

			<div>
				<h2 class="section">3. Example Programs</h2>
				<p>
					The following sample program reads a sequence of values from the LEFT port, doubling each
					value read and writing that to the RIGHT port. Because of the automatic looping behavior
					of the Basic Execution Node, it continues to the first instruction after executing the
					last instruction.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>MOV LEFT, ACC</dt>
					<dd>Read a value from the LEFT port into the ACC register.</dd>

			<h1 class="page-title">NODE TYPE T30 - STACK MEMORY NODE</h1>
			<hr class="solid" />
			<div>
				<h2 class="section">1. Architecture</h2>
				<p>
					The Stack Memory Node enables read/write access to a large number of values according to a
					simple stack-based communication protocol. (Refer to the model-specific manual to find the
					capacity of the Stack Memory Nodes on a particular device.)
				</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 class="section">2. Communication Protocol</h2>
				<p>
					All interaction with the Stack Memory Node is performed through ports. Writing to the
					Stack Memory Node adds the value to the top of the stack. If the stack is full, the write
					will block until space becomes available. Reading from the Stack Memory Node removes the
					top value from the stack and produces that value. If the stack is empty, the read will
					block until a value is available.
				</p>
				<p>
					Stack Memory Nodes are typically connected to multiple other nodes, and can be used by any
					connected node. Simultaneous reads and writes to a Stack Memory Node resolve in an
					undefined order, but each individual communication will behave according to the described
					communication protocol. For more information on using storage nodes from multiple nodes
					effectively and predictably, refer to the separate document “Tessellated Intelligence
					System Best Practices - Patterns of Node Communication”.
