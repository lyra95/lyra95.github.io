[TIS-100](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/) is a puzzle game on Steam.
The game is to solve puzzles by writing assembly code for a fictional computer.
The game provides a [manual](https://www.vidarholen.net/contents/junk/files/TIS-100%20Reference%20Manual.pdf) in scanned PDF format, which is not searchable.

I thought it would be nice to have a searchable version of the manual, so I wrote [one](./resource/index.html) in HTML/CSS.
